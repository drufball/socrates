# Socrates

Socrates is an **interactive discussion board** for product-minded tech workers (especially in AI) who want a more **active content-consumption** experience.

## Motivation

People want to spend their free time doing active, enriching things but they're exhausted by **decisions** from the day. They turn to autopilot scrolling when they actually *do* have the energy to engage more actively.

Socrates gives the no-decision, "on rails" ease of passive reading while turning the experience into a **low-friction, high-engagement** thinking loop.

Instead of passively reading a blog/newsletter, you drop into a guided conversation with an LLM-powered discussion partner. When you're done, Socrates produces a durable artifact: a post that represents **your** views—added to the zine for others to read.

## Product vocabulary

- **Product Market Fit**: The name of the zine. `fit()` is stylised like the ML training method.
- **Issue**: one release centered on a topic (labeled in-product as **No. X**).
- **Post**: the final artifact generated from a user's conversation, representing the **user's** views for that issue.
