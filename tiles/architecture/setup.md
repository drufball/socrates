# Setup (WIP)

This repo is still in the “bootstrap” stage. As code lands, this doc will become the canonical dev setup guide.

## Prerequisites (intended)

- `fnm` (Fast Node Manager) to manage Node.js versions (for `frontend/`)
- `pyenv` to manage Python versions (for `backend/`)
- `uv` to manage Python packages (for `backend/`)
- Postgres (or a Supabase project)

## Local development (planned)

We expect a monorepo structure:

- `frontend/` — Next.js app
- `backend/` — FastAPI app

Once scaffolded, this doc should include:

- install steps
- environment variables (`.env` examples)
- database migrations
- running web + api locally
